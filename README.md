## PedalinoMini™ 4

An easy way to create one is by building the [PedalinoMini™ 4](https://github.com/alf45tar/PedalinoMini-4). I aimed to keep it as simple as possible.

[PedalinoMini™ 4](https://github.com/alf45tar/PedalinoMini-4) operates seamlessly with its 4 footswitches, featuring a big 1.9" color display equipped with WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB capabilities. It is powered through a USB-C port from the computer or using either a power adapter or, for enhanced convenience, a compact power bank, ensuring up to 6 hours of uninterrupted functionality.
