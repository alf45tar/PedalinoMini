## How to connect PedalinoMini™ to a WiFi network

PedalinoMini™ supports IEEE 802.11 b/g/n WiFi with WPA/WPA2 authentication (only 2.4 GHz).

PedalinoMini™ support 5 WiFi provisioning methods: 1 via USB, 1 via Bluetooth and 3 via WiFi.

PedalinoMini™ is using [ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) not only to install the firmware, via USB with a click of button right from you browser, but also to connect it to WiFi with the same simplicity via USB or Bluetooth.

PedalinoMini™ also implements Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and Smart Config technology ([Espressif’s ESP-TOUCH protocol](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-touch/overview)). WPS needs access to the WPS button on the WiFi router. Smart Config requires a smartphone with one the following apps:

- [ESP8266 SmartConfig](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmmakerclub.iot.esptouch) for Android
- [Espressif Esptouch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/espressif-esptouch/id1071176700?mt=8) for iOS

If the WiFi network is not available PedalinoMini™ will create an hotspot for you. Once connected to the PedalinoMini™ hotspot, you can use the web interface to set the SSID and password of an access point that you would like to connect to.

- On power on PedalinoMini™ will try to connect to the last know access point
- If it cannot connect to the last used access point within 15 seconds it enters into WiFi provisioning mode via USB or Bluetooth
- Visit http://alf45tar.github.io/PedalinoMini and follow the instructions
- If provisioning is not finished within 60 seconds it enters into Smart Config mode
- Start one of the suggested apps to configure SSID and password
- If it doesn't receive any SSID and password during the next 60 seconds it enters into WPS mode
- Press or press and hold (it depends by your router) the WPS button on your WiFi router __after__ PedalinoMini™ entered in WPS mode
- If it doesn't receive any SSID and password during the next 60 seconds it switch to AP mode
- In AP mode PedalinoMini™ create a WiFi network called 'Pedalino-XXXXXXXX' waiting connection from clients. The required password is XXXXXXXX (uppercase). XXXXXXXX is a variable string.
- Reboot PedalinoMini™ to restart the procedure.

Any of the previous steps can be skipped pressing BOOT button.

## How to connect to the web user intertace

The responsive and mobile-first configuration web user interface is available on `http://device-name.local` address (the address is case insensitive). The device identification name is unique per device. Every device/board has a different device name. For example I am using `http://2ab267ac.local` to connect to my PedalinoMini™.

In order to know your device name and/or the IP address press for at least half a second the BOOT button and check the display.

As alternative method you can use the IP address. If you are using the AP mode the IP address is always `192.168.4.1` and the connection address is `http://192.168.4.1` for everyone.

There is no credentials to connect to web user interface. Device name and credentials to connect to web user interface can be changed in the Options page.
